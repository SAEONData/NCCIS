                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>NFCS strives to enable society to better manage the risks and opportunities arising from climate variability and change, especially for those who are most vulnerable to climate related hazards.</p>
                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>The NFCS will mainstream and enhance climate observations and monitoring information, forecasting and prediction and transform these into sector -specific products and applications that can be disseminated widely, and further develop usersâ€™ capacity to manage risks of climate variability and change at all levels. This will be done through developing and incorporating science based climate information into planning, policy and practice. To be effective, the NFCS-SA will be user driven, and will address the entire value chain for the production, processing and application of climate services through local, regional and global collaborative efforts. The NFCS-SA will serve as one of enabling tools for South Africa, in the transition towards building a climate resilient country.</p>

                    <p>The NFCS has five overarching goals, namely:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Reducing the vulnerability of society to climate related hazards through better provision of climate information;</li>
                      <li>Advancing the key national development goals through better provision of climate information;</li>
                      <li>Mainstreaming the use of climate information in decision-making;</li>
                      <li>Strengthening the engagement of providers and users of climate services; and</li>
                      <li>Maximising the utility of existing climate service infrastructure.</li>

                    <p>User Interface Platform is the pillar of the Framework that provides a structured means for users, climate researchers and climate data and information providers to interact at all levels. The objective of the User Interface Platform is to promote effective decision making with respect to climate considerations by making sure that the right information, at the right time and in the right amount, is delivered, understood, and used.</p>

                    <p>It is the principal mechanism through which information about climate (past, present and future) is routinely collected, stored and processed to generate products and services that inform decision-making processes, often complex, across a wide range of climate-sensitive activities and enterprises. It is the means by which research outputs and technological developments are transformed into improved operational climate information.</p>

Areas included in the capacity development pillar are governance, management, human resources development, education and training, leadership, partnership creation, science communication, service delivery, resource mobilization and infrastructure.  It is the overarching pillar since the functions undertaken in all the other four pillars (UIP, CSIS, observation and monitoring, research, modelling and prediction) depend on the available capacity. In the context of climate services, capacity development refers to the investment in people, infrastructure, practices and institutions in order to manage and assess climate related risk by providing decision relevant climate information and products.</p>

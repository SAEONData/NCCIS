                The Department of Environmental Affairs Climate Change Information System (CCIS) was designed to monitor
                and track South Africaâ€™s progress on climate change, to that end, nine desired adaptation outcome
                goals were developed to establish progress across the country.

                A simple pragmatic approach has been developed to monitor and evaluate the progress being made
                in achieving individual desired adaptation outcomes using traffic light colours as a scoring
                system to summarise progress.

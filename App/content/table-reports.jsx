      Description: 'This report provides quantitative economic analyses of climate change impacts and the inferred estimated adaptation costs in key sectors, including water, agriculture and biodiversity and ecosystem services, up to 2050. It highlights that the costing of climate change adaptation responses and their benefits (calculated in terms of avoided damages) is still in its infancy, especially when compared to the advances made with respect to determining mitigation costs, and further outlines some of the challenges particular to economic analyses of adaptation. The report draws attention to the unique challenges of developing adaptation responses in the face of climate uncertainty, as well as the opportunities and benefits that adaptation responses can potentially provide, particularly in terms of local economic development. It concludes with recommendations of the conditions and actions required for an effective integrated adaptation response in the short, medium and long term.',
